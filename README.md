# Measuring-Software-Engineering
## Introduction
Measuring employee performance is a practice in every industry. Managers will often schedule periodic performance reviews to evaluate if their team-member is meeting a required standard. Metrics are an essential part of this evaluation, often being the central point of analysis and discussion (AIHR Analytics, 2020). For most roles in large companies, the gathering and study of these metrics is relatively simple. For example, when measuring the performance of a technical recruiter, it is clear that the number of successful hires that they contribute to the company is a useful metric when determining if they are succeeding in their role. The number of sales that a salesperson makes is an indication of their job performance. While the above examples are not too robust, they illustrate that for some roles, there are clear employee metrics that are useful when determining employee performance.  

In the case of software engineering, we cannot use traditional metrics (TechBeacon, 2020). The nature of software engineering allows for the measurement of an abundance metrics, such as the number of commits per day, the average size of commits, the number of pull requests merged, etc. While these metrics can be somewhat useful in determining the productivity of a software engineer, they are not always the most unambiguous indication of their job performance. This report will discuss why some traditional metrics don't work, some modern metrics that are more beneficial to analyse and the ethical implications of these metrics.
